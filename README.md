<h2>Components</h2>
* HC-SR501 was used to detect motion. This module is based on infrared technology and it has 120 degree view limit.<br>
* DHT11 sensor includes a resistive-type humidity measurement component, an temperature measurement component, so it basically provides us temperature and humidity data.<br>
* LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) was using to display alarm menu, temperature, humidity and so on.<br>
* Lastly, Arduino Nano was using to process data and manage other algorithms.<br>
