# ARXALARM
This is a simple thief detection alarm project.

<h2>Components</h2>
HC-SR501 was used to detect motion. This module is based on infrared technology and it has 120 degree view limit.<br>
DHT11 sensor includes a resistive-type humidity measurement component, an temperature measurement component, so it basically provides us temperature and humidity data.<br>
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) was using to display alarm menu, temperature, humidity and so on.<br>
Lastly, Arduino Nano was using to process data and manage other algorithms.<br>

<h2>How to make it work?</h2>
First thing you have to do is setting your password and system clock time. After that, you can set your alarm time interval. Now you are ready to detect thieves!<br>

<h2>Additional Info</h2>
You do not have to always set system time but you will have to change its battery.
