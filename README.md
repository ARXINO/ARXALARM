# ARXALARM
This is a simple thief detection alarm project.

<h2>Components</h2>
HC-SR501 was used to detect motion. This module is based on infrared technology and it has 120 degree view limit.<br>
DHT11 sensor includes a resistive-type humidity measurement component, an temperature measurement component, so it basically provides us temperature and humidity data.<br>
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) was used to display alarm menu, temperature, humidity and so on.<br>
Lastly, Arduino Nano was used to process data and manage other algorithms.<br>
